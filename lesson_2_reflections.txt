1. What happens when you initiate a repository? Why do you
need to do it?

When you initiate a repository, your directory is now
in Git territory. You can start Version Control,
creating commits, checking statuses, etc.  You
need to do this to use Git in a specific directory.

2. How is the staging area different from the working
directory and the repository? What value do you think
it offers?

The staging area is a place where you put files before
you create a commit. It's like putting items on a backdrop
before taking a picture to list the item on ebay. Placing
the item on the backdrop is adding it to the staging area,
and pressing the shutter button is like a commit. The
working directory is helpful, because that is where all of
your files (whether they're in the repository or not)
currently are. The repository is the place where you put
the files that you want to save and track over time.
