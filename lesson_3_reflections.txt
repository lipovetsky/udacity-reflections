1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather
than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository is useful both when you are working with
others, and when you are working from different computers.
It also helps as a backup in case your hard drive crashes, etc.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date on your remote
repository?

If you have automatic pulls, then it might overwrite important
changes and updates to files that you're working on. You don't
want this! Maybe you're working on some experimental feature
on GitHub, and you're not ready to sync it to your local
repository.

3. Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a GitHub-only feature. It allows you to copy another
Git repository to your own account. A clone via GitHub. A regular
clone, however, lets you copy a remote repository hosted on GitHub
and copy it to your local computer. It's also what happens when you
copy and paste a folder in your computer from one location to another.
An exact clone. A branch, on the other hand, is done within a
repository, and it allows you to copy and paste all of the files in
your project in order work on a new feature. It's like an internal clone.
