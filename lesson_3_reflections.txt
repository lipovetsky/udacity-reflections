1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather
than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository is useful both when you are working with
others, and when you are working from different computers.
It also helps as a backup in case your hard drive crashes, etc.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date on your remote
repository?

If you have automatic pulls, then it might overwrite important
changes and updates to files that you're working on. You don't
want this! Maybe you're working on some experimental feature
on GitHub, and you're not ready to sync it to your local
repository.
